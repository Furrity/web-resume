        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a self‑driven back‑end developer with 2.5 years of professional
          experience in Python (Django, DRF) and Go. I design, build and
          maintain production‑grade services, CI/CD pipelines and DevOps
          tooling. I partner closely with frontend teams and product managers to
          drive architecture decisions, ensure smooth deployments of
          containerized applications, and continuously improve reliability and
          performance. Currently deepening my Go expertise by rebuilding my own
          resume site in Go.

              after realizing it lacked the functionality we needed for routing
              CI/CD notifications to specific discussion threads. I opened an
              issue, implemented the feature, and the pull request was merged
              shortly after. This improvement is now part of our deployment
              workflow and actively used in production.
